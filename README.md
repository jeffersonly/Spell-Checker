# Spell-Checker
 ##Description
Stores a dictionary text file using a Red Black Tree and checks text files to verify whether or not words exist in the dictionary. Returns the number of words that do not exist in the dictionary.

The project is written in Java.
This project is originally a project assignment for a Data Structures and Algorithms class at SJSU (CS 146).

##Steps 
1. Find/Create a dictionary text file that contains all words that you want to check for (this can be done through webcrawling or manual input)

2. Create a text file that contains the text that you want to spell check.

3. Run the program, the program once executed will display the amount of time it took as well as how many words are wrong within the text. 

**Future improvision of project can be to create a text file showcasing all of the mispelled words**
